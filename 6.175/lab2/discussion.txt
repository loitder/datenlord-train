1.Discussion Question 1 (1 Point): Hardware-wise, unsigned addition is the same as signed addition 
    when using two's complement encoding. Using evidence from the test bench, 
        is unsigned multiplication the same as signed multiplication?

-----   
    not same,the test bench output :
        FAILED:
            if signed: -26519 * 18547 test function gave -491847893 instead of 723648299
            if unsigned: 39017 * 18547 test function gave 3803119403 instead of 723648299

2.Discussion Question 2 (2 Points): In mkTBDumb excluding the line
        function Bit#(16) test_function( Bit#(8) a, Bit#(8) b ) = multiply_unsigned( a, b );
and modifying the rest of the module to have

    (* synthesize *)
    module mkTbDumb();
        Empty tb <- mkTbMulFunction(multiply_unsigned, multiply_unsigned, True);
        return tb;
    endmodule
will result in a compilation error. What is that error? How does the original code fix the compilation error? 
    You could also fix the error by having two function definitions as shown below.

-----
    "Bit vector of unknown size"
-----


    (* synthesize *)
    module mkTbDumb();
        function Bit#(16) test_function( Bit#(8) a, Bit#(8) b ) = multiply_unsigned( a, b );
        function Bit#(16) ref_function( Bit#(8) a, Bit#(8) b ) = multiply_unsigned( a, b );
        Empty tb <- mkTbMulFunction(test_function, ref_function, True);
        return tb;
    endmodule
Why is two function definitions not necessary? (i.e. why can the second operand to mkTbMulFunction have variables in its type?) 
Hint: Look at the types of the operands of mkTbMulFunction in TestBenchTemplates.bsv.

-----
    the compiler support automatic inference, the first parameter has specified the n(bit width) of the parameter

3.Discussion Question 3 (1 Point): Is your implementation of multiply_by_adding a signed multiplier or an unsigned multiplier? (Note: if it does not match either multiply_signed or multiply_unsigned, it is wrong).

-----
    unsigned

4.Discussion Question 4 (1 Point): Fill in above table in discussion.txt. 
    None of the Radix-4 Booth encodings should have more than one non-zero symbol in them.

Current Bits | Previous Bit | Original Booth Encoding | Radix-4 Booth Encoding
-------------+--------------+-------------------------+-----------------------
    00       |      0       |           00            |         00
    00       |      1       |           0+            |         0+
    01       |      0       |           +-            |         0+
    01       |      1       |           +0            |         +0

    11       |      0       |           0-            |         0-
    11       |      1       |           00            |         00

5.Discussion Question 5 (1 Point): 
    Now consider extending your Booth multiplier even further to a radix-8 Booth multiplier. 
        This would be like doing 3 steps of the radix-2 Booth multiplier in a single step. 
    Can all radix-8 Booth encodings be represented with only one non-zero symbol like the radix-4 Booth multiplier? 
        Do you think it would still make sense to make a radix-8 Booth multiplier?

-----
    (1) yes
    (2) radix-8 Booth multiplier require more mux 、 higher bit width registers ,
         so it may not be suitable for use in some resource-constrained situations.
            However, the radix-8 Booth multiplier maybe meaningful in computational tasks that require
                a large number of multiplication operations.
