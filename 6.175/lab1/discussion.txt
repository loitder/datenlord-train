Write your answers to these questions in the text file discussion.txt provided with the initial lab code.

1. How many gates does your one-bit multiplexer use? The 5-bit multiplexer? 
    Write down a formula for the number of gates in an N-bit multiplexer. (2 Points)
    (1) one-bit : 4 (1 not + 2 and + 1 or)
    (2) 5-bit : 4 * 5
    (3) formula : n * 5

2. Assume a single full adder requires 5 gates. How many gates does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder require? 
    How many gates does the 8-bit carry-select adder require? (2 Points)
    (1) rca : 8 * 5 (8 full adder)
    (2) csa : 80
        adder       : 3(adder4) * 4(full adder) * 5
        5-bit mux   : 4 * 5




3. Assume a single full adder requires A time unit to compute its outputs 
    once all its inputs are valid and a mux requires M time unit to compute its output. 
        In terms of A and M, how long does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder take? 
        How long does the 8-bit carry-select adder take? (2 Points)
    (1) rsa : 8 * A
    (2) csa : 4 * A + M


4. Optional: How long did you take to work on this lab?
    2 hours
